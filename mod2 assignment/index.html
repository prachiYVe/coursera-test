		<span style="background-color:black">Sales</span>
		<p>Sales personnel focus on a particular market or a particular (set of) client(s), often for a targeted revenue number. In this case, business development assesses the Brazilian markets and concludes that sales worth $1.5 billion can be achieved in three years. With such set goals, the sales department targets the customer base in the new market with their sales strategies.</p>

		<span style="background-color:#C133FF; color:black">Marketing</span>
		<p>Marketing involves promotion and advertising aimed towards the successful sale of products to end-customers. Marketing plays a complementary role in achieving sales targets. Business development initiatives may allocate an estimated marketing budget. Higher budgets allow aggressive marketing strategies like cold calling, personal visits, road shows, and free sample distribution.</p>

		<span style="background-color:#FFB533; color:blue">Product Management</span>
		<p>Regulatory standards and market requirements vary across countries. A medicine of a certain composition may be allowed in India but not in the U.K., for example. Does the new market require a customized - or altogether new - version of the product? These requirements drive the work of product management and manufacturing departments, as decided by the business strategy.</p>
